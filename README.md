# Ansible
This is some Ansible stuff I am testing

The ultimate goal is to create a complete VPC based on a
config file, then launch servers based on a defined
architecture and deploy applications. I also want to tear
it all down.

Given a pre-defined VPC, the ec2, rds and application bits
are working. I left the VPC work for last because it seemed
like the hard part. It is.
